## What is this?
The Public Data Trust (PDT) is an archive of information about the known galaxy, its history, and the people who inhabit it. The PDT Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing accurate and reliable information to the public. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and accessible resource for anyone interested in learning more about the universe we live in.

## Are you affiliated with the HGF?
While we may receive funding from the Hadieia Galactic Federation (HGF) to assist with our operational costs, we are an independent organization. Our mission is to provide unbiased and accurate information to the public, regardless of our funding sources. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data governance and compliance, and we take our responsibility to the public very seriously.

## What can I find here?
You can find a wide range of information on our website, including articles, research papers, and other resources related to the universe and its history. We are constantly updating and expanding our archive, so be sure to check back often for new content.

## How can I help?
We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in helping us build and maintain the PDT archive. If you have information or resources that you think would be valuable to our archive, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are always looking for new ways to improve our archive and make it more accessible to the public.

## What are the next steps?
We are currently working on expanding our archive to include more information about the known galaxy and its inhabitants. We are also exploring new ways to make our archive more accessible and user-friendly, including the development of new tools and resources for researchers and the general public. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are always looking for ways to improve our archive and make it more useful to the public.

## Conclusion
We are excited to launch the PDT Foundation's public archive and look forward to sharing our knowledge and resources with the people of Hadieia. We believe that access to accurate and reliable information is essential for the advancement of society, and we are committed to providing that information to the public.
