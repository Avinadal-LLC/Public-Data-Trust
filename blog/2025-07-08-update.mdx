Right, let's clear something up, since, thanks to the *enthusiasm* of our newest Associate Research Analyst, it seems some clarification is needed. This news feed is an internal PDT channel. For us: The people who actually work here. It's not a public soapbox for auditioning for a spot on the Federal Council. Most of us figured that out on day one.

Apparently, Dr. Yilu-Grav missed that memo. He also apparently missed the one about proofreading... As a quick update, I suppose, Dr. Yilu-Grav has locked somehow himself out of the post. According to folks in IT, Greg decided to password protect his blog post to make sure no one took credit for his work. A real problem for him, I'm sure.

After password locking the post, he seems to have misplaced the password. IT has had to use the PDT's censorship tool to hide his mistakes and typos. Really putting our IT team to good, productive, useful work.

Speaking of things getting misplaced, management is still breathing down our necks about the recurring loss of exploration drones in CUWP territory. Every report comes back the same: the drones just vanish. No distress signal, no debris, nothing. Just multi-million credit pieces of HGF hardware disappearing into the void. Another report gets filed, another ticket gets closed, and we all move on. Frankly, I'm paid to collate the data, not understand it. At this rate, we'll have fully documented the precise coordinates of our own incompetence.

Now, for the site updates. Remember, people, screwing up this feed is one thing, but putting bad information on the public-facing site, Will. Get. You. Fired.

**Public Updates:**
* From Cul-His:
  * Small cultural blurb has been added to the Metaphysical Energies document. This was upon request from the higher-ups; out of my pay grade, ask them.
* From Astro:
  * New ERR published.
  * New EMDR published. Not sure why... see above.

Senior Data Analyst, General Research

<HtmlComment>And clearly underpaid! Did you know? Dr. Vicceni has a degree in quantum physics. What is the HGF doing assigning their quantum scientists to data processing? No wonder CUWP is just ignoring them now.</HtmlComment>
