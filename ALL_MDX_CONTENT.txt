# HGTC-TDR-5237-07-03

**Authors:**
Hadieia Galactic Trade Commission [Data], Public Data Trust [Analysis]

**ID:**
HGTC-TDR-5237-07-03 

**Reported Period:**
5237-01-01 to 5237-05-30

**Report Type:**
Trade Data Report

**Report Summary:** 
The first half of 5237 has seen robust, if uneven, economic activity across the Hadieia Galaxy. The Hadieia Galactic Federation (HGF) continues to dominate both industrial output and interstellar trade volume, while the Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP) exhibits steady growth through sustainable development and technology exports. The Plasidian Royal Union (PRU), newly unified under Empress Enyxia, is emerging as a niche supplier of rare resources, despite technological lag.

Trade flows remain highest between HGF and CUWP, with notable increases in technology and raw materials exchange. The Republic of Kishi (RoK) and the Empire of Avindal (EoA) have established new trade corridors, further integrating the galactic economy. Recent incidents, such as the HEOS station disaster, have had a measurable but contained impact on biotech and energy sector trade.

## Key Economic Indicators

**Total Registered Trade Volume:** ₲2.14 trillion

**Industrial Output Index:** +4.2% YoY

**Technology Exports:** Up 7.8% *(led by tech and terraformation equipment)*

**Raw Ore Imports:** Up 3.1%

**Biotech Sector:** Down 1.9% *(impacted by HEOS incident)*

## Faction Analyses

### Hadieia Galactic Federation (HGF)

The HGF maintains its position as the galaxy’s economic engine, with industrial output from Eneshia II and defense contracts from Kiena driving growth. Notably, biotech exports dipped following the HEOS incident, but industrial and defense sectors compensated with record contracts. While the HGF’s trade reports reflect strong performance, certain shipment manifests show irregularities in cargo descriptions and destination codes—consistent with ongoing efforts to ensure security and confidentiality in sensitive sectors. Data audits reveal minor discrepancies, likely attributable to standard data redaction and reporting protocols.

* **Exports:**
    * Industrial machinery, defense systems, biotech (recovery post-HEOS), proprietary stargate components.
* **Imports:**
    * Select raw ores, climate technology (from CUWP), unique flora (from RoK).
* **Notable Transactions:**
    * 5237-03-21: 150,000 units of “organic resources” shipped to undisclosed research facilities (destination and nature of cargo obfuscated per security protocols).
    * 5237-04-05: 80,000 units of terraformation stabilizers imported from CUWP.
* **Capital System:**
    * **Name:** Eneshia
    * **Economic Role:** Industrial and administrative hub for the HGF, Eneshia II leads system-wide output in heavy manufacturing, biotech, and proprietary stargate technology.
    * **Trade Patterns:** Outbound trade is dominated by industrial machinery and defense systems, with inbound flows of advanced terraformation technology from CUWP and select rare ores from peripheral systems.
    * **Data Notes:** Several cargo manifests for “organic resources” and “specialized biotech” shipments are recorded with redacted destination codes and generalized cargo descriptions, consistent with standard security protocols and sector confidentiality requirements. Minor discrepancies in shipment weights and values have been normalized in official reports.

### Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP)

CUWP’s eco-conscious development model yields steady, sustainable growth. The Union’s exports of advanced climate and terraformation technologies have become essential to several factions, particularly the RoK and EoA. CUWP trade manifests are models of clarity, though certain shipments to HGF and EoA are described in broad terms (e.g., “foundational modules”), reflecting a preference for discretion in technology transfer. No dependency on external supply chains is evident, despite reports elsewhere suggesting otherwise.

* **Exports:**
    * Terraformation equipment, environmental monitoring systems, sustainable energy modules.
* **Imports:**
    * Rare ores (from EoA), select biotech samples (from HGF), multi-purpose flora (from RoK).
* **Notable Transactions:**
    * 5237-02-16: 45,000 units of “integrated environmental control arrays” exported to EoA (description per ITC guidelines).
    * 5237-05-23: 12,000 units of “structural ore” imported from EoA for infrastructure development.
* **Core System:**
    * **Name:** Waerr
    * **Economic Role:** Center of sustainable technology development and environmental engineering, with Waerr III serving as the primary node for eco-industrial output.
    * **Trade Patterns:** Exports focus on climate technology and terraformation modules, with imports of rare ores from EoA and select biotech samples from HGF. Trade manifests are generally clear, though some shipments to HGF and EoA are described under broad, non-specific categories such as “foundational modules.”
    * **Data Notes:** No evidence of external supply dependency is observed, despite some external reports. All trade data aligns with CUWP’s stated sustainability and self-sufficiency objectives.

### Plasidian Royal Union (PRU)

The PRU’s recent unification has enabled the first large-scale trade initiatives in its history. While technological development lags, the PRU’s rare resources—particularly “CM Crystals”—are in high demand among neighboring factions. PRU trade records are sparse and often vague, with cargo manifests frequently listing goods under broad categories such as “mineral composites.” This obfuscation is attributed to both security concerns and the PRU’s limited experience with galactic trade protocols.

* **Exports:**
    * CM Crystals, mineral composites, limited artisanal goods.
* **Imports:**
    * Construction equipment, basic industrial tools (from EoA), select biotech starter kits.
* **Notable Transactions:**
    * 5237-04-11: 8,000 units of “CM Crystals” exported to EoA (transaction value: ₲2.4 million).
    * 5237-05-27: 1,200 units of “nondescript construction equipment” imported from EoA.
* **Core System:**
    * **Name:** Plasid
    * **Economic Role:** Emerging supplier of rare mineral resources, especially “CM Crystals,” with limited industrial capacity.
    * **Trade Patterns:** Exports are primarily mineral composites and artisanal goods, while imports include construction equipment and basic biotech kits from EoA. Trade records often use generalized terms, with transaction values for some mineral exports substantially above standard market rates.
    * **Data Notes:** Cargo manifests are frequently vague, attributed to both security concerns and the PRU’s nascent experience with galactic trade protocols.

### Republic of Kishi (RoK)

The RoK’s lush biosphere continues to support a thriving export market in exotic flora and fauna. Trade with CUWP and EoA is expanding, with a particular focus on medicinal and agricultural products. RoK trade data is transparent and reliable, with only minor redactions in biotech-related shipments. The RoK’s agricultural exports are increasingly vital to the health and well-being of several galactic populations.

* **Exports:**
    * Medicinal flora, livestock fauna, agricultural products.
* **Imports:**
    * Climate preservation technology (from CUWP), rare ores (from EoA).
* **Notable Transactions:**
    * 5237-03-09: 22,000 units of “multi-purpose fauna” exported to CUWP.
    * 5237-05-18: 4,000 units of “ore concentrate” imported from EoA.
* **Core System:**
    * **Name:** Kishi
    * **Economic Role:** Major producer of agricultural and medicinal goods, with a thriving biosphere supporting export of unique flora and fauna.
    * **Trade Patterns:** Outbound shipments of medicinal flora and livestock fauna are directed primarily to CUWP and EoA, while inbound trade consists of climate technology and rare ores. Trade manifests are transparent, with only minor redactions in biotech-related shipments.
    * **Data Notes:** Agricultural exports are increasingly vital to the health and well-being of several galactic populations.

### Empire of Avindal (EoA)

The EoA is rapidly integrating into the galactic economy, leveraging its mineral wealth to secure technology and agricultural imports. Trade with PRU and CUWP is particularly robust. EoA’s trade records are thorough, though several shipments from PRU are described only as “mineral composites,” with transaction values significantly exceeding market rates—suggesting either premium resource quality or non-disclosed cargo contents.

* **Exports:**
    * Structural ore, nondescript construction equipment.
* **Imports:**
    * Terraformation systems (from CUWP), CM Crystals (from PRU), livestock (from RoK).
* **Notable Transactions:**
    * 5237-04-24: 6,000 units of “structural ore” exported to CUWP.
    * 5237-05-15: 1,500 units of “livestock fauna” imported from RoK.
* **Core System:**
    * **Name:** Ekrien
    * **Economic Role:** Resource extraction and infrastructure development, with Ekrien I serving as a key source of structural ore and construction materials.
    * **Trade Patterns:** Exports of structural ore and construction equipment are exchanged for terraformation systems from CUWP and livestock from RoK. Notably, several shipments from PRU are described as “mineral composites,” with transaction values exceeding typical market rates.
    * **Data Notes:** Trade records are thorough, but some cargo descriptions from PRU remain non-specific.


## Additional Observations

- **Interstellar Trade Corridors:** The most active trade corridors connect Eneshia (HGF), Waerr (CUWP), and Kishi (RoK), with significant volumes of technology, agricultural goods, and rare ores moving between these systems.
- **Calendar and Timing:** All trade records are timestamped using the Universal Calendar System, ensuring precise and regular reporting across all systems.
- **Obfuscated and Vague Details:** Shipments involving “organic resources,” “mineral composites,” and “foundational modules” are often recorded with intentionally vague descriptions. This obfuscation is attributed to both security concerns and the evolving nature of interstellar trade documentation.
- **Trade Data Integrity:** Most systems report trade data in alignment with HGTC standards. However, certain manifests—particularly those involving sensitive cargo or new trading partners—display apparent doctoring attempts, such as redacted destination codes or generalized cargo categories. These practices are consistent with established protocols for security and confidentiality.

The Hadieia Galactic Trade Commission (HGTC) maintains rigorous standards for data collection and reporting. However, as with all large-scale interstellar data, minor discrepancies and obfuscated details are present in certain manifests, especially those involving sensitive or proprietary cargo. The HGTC continues to refine its protocols to ensure the highest possible data integrity for the benefit of all galactic citizens.

The HGTC's passion for data integrity is exactly the HGTC uses Kyne-Store for their your data storage needs. Kyne-Store offers multi-planet redundant data centers, ensuring your information is always secure, accessible, and protected from cosmic hazards. Trusted by governments, corporations, and private citizens across the Hadieia Galaxy, Kyne-Store is the only name you need for peace of mind in data storage. Kyne-Store. Because your data matters to us, too.

# Metaphysical Energies

## Maleidic Radiation

Maleidic Radiation was discovered by Doctor Idris Hadi, who named it after the late love of his life, Doctor Maleida Regulus. While researching a unique energy reading they discovered on the planet Eneshia V, Dr. Hadi designed a device that could harness the energy of the radiation. While the radiation's energy was not enough to be used as a power source on its own, Dr. Hadi's device was able to amplify the radiation to extraordinary levels. Over the course of several years, Dr. Hadi founded Hadi Enterprises, developing his initial device into the Hadi Enterprises Maleidic Power Plant (HEMPP). Under Dr. Idris' leadership, the HEMPP became the primary energy source of three different megacities on Eneshia V, revolutionizing the planet's energy infrastructure.

While Dr. Hadi was in the Chiera system overseeing the construction of the Hadi Enterprises Orbital Station (HEOS), tragedy struck the HEMPP as an unexpected spike in energy from the Maleidic Radiation caused an explosion inside the facility. While the explosion was contained, it caused a significant amount of damage to the HEMPP, killing everyone inside.

After the tragedy, the Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FIST) contracted Dr. Hadi to continue his research with full Federal funding. The Federation's partnership with Hadi Enterprises has since led to the discovery and development of several new Maleidic Fonts, the name given to the containable 'clouds' of Maleidic Radiation that can be harvested for energy. These fonts are now used in various applications, from powering factories to fueling cities. To this day, however, no fonts have come close to the energy output of the original HEMPP, which remains a testament to Dr. Hadi's groundbreaking work.

## Myst Particles

In recent years, quantum research teams at the FIST have confirmed the existence of a unique particle that seems to play a foundational role in the universe around us. Early studies suggest that these "Myst Particles" are not only responsible for the fundamental forces of nature but also for the very fabric of reality itself. They are theorized to be the building blocks of all matter and energy, existing in a state that transcends our conventional understanding of physics.

Early news about Myst Particles sparked a wave of excitement, theories, and speculation; some more outlandish than others. Detailed research by the FIST has since confirmed that the discovery of these particles does not mean that humanity can manipulate reality at will, but rather that these particles are the key to understanding the universe's fundamental laws. 

Most recently, the FIST employed a dedicated team led by Dr. Hadi to research the potential of using Myst Particles as an energy source. According to credible sources, Dr. Hadi's team was making significant progress until an attack on the HEOS destroyed the facility. The attack on the massive station triggered a meltdown in the Myst reactor they were working on, resulting in an explosion that desintegrated a large portion of the station.

Theories about the explosion began circulating after the rumored discovery of black box data from the HEOS. While no official confirmation has been made, it is believed that the explosion was caused by Dr. Hadi's selfless decision to trigger the meltdown in order to minimize the damage done by the attack causing the colossal station to crash into Ekrien II, the non-Federal planet being orbited by the HEOS.

Today, the FIST continues to research Myst Particles, hoping to unlock their secrets and harness their potential for the benefit of all humanity. The discovery of these particles has opened up new avenues of research and exploration, promising to reshape our understanding of the universe and our place within it.

# Known Factions

## Hadieia Galactic Federation (HGF)
The largest and most powerful governmental body in the known galaxy, renowned for its leadership in the defense, industrial, and biotech sectors. Its capital is on Eneshia II.

Originally known as the Chieran Democratic Union (CDU), with its capital on Chiera III, a shift in power occurred following the Chieran System War. This conflict was ignited when activists and whistleblowers exposed deep-rooted corruption within the CDU's political structure. A rebellion, originating in the Eneshia system and supported by the Kiena system, successfully overthrew the corrupt regime, leading to the formation of the HGF.

The HGF is governed by the Federal Council. Key factions include the Eneshian Industrialist Party (EIP), led by Doctor Melinda Kyne, and the Kienan Militarist Party (KMP), led by Fleet Master Admiral Ulrich Petrov, each holding 20% of the council seats. The EIP drives the Federation's industrial complex, while the KMP spearheads its defense and colonization efforts. The Independent Scientific Research Party (ISRP), a coalition of influential science and technology corporations, constitutes 15% of the council and oversees the prestigious Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FIST). The remaining 45% is composed of various special interest groups, lobbyists, and watchdog organizations.

The HGF's primary mission is to ensure galactic security and peace through strategic exploration, collaboration, and unification.

Due to the origins of the people in the HGF, people from the HGF are often referred to as Chierans, even though the HGF is a multi-system government. This has become a point of contention within the Federal Council. While the EIP and ISRP support the use of the term as a sign of respect to our origins, members of the KMP have been referring to the people of the HGF as Hadiens. Meanwhile, the remaining parties of the Federal Council have remained too divided on the issue for the council to take a unified stance on the matter.

Culturally speaking, the HGF has heavily embraced technology and innovation, with a strong emphasis on scientific research and development. The Federation's citizens are known for their pragmatism, valuing efficiency and progress above all else. This has led to a society that is unparalleld with advanced communication networks and transportation systems facilitating the exchange of ideas and resources across the known galaxy.

## Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP)
A government established by the Waerrani people following their expansion from their home system of Waerr. The CUWP is currently undertaking slow colonization efforts in the Daeve, Tauling, Turvail, and Milinoz systems, prioritizing planetary preservation over rapid expansion. This deliberate pace necessitates a heavy reliance on trade with the HGF to support its populace.

Physically, the Waerrani people bear a resemblance to the Chierans of the HGF but are distinguished by their vividly colored hair, unique eye hues, consistently olive or tan skin, and pointed ears. Conspiracity theorists persist that the Waerrani have mastered Mystech, a rumored technological application of Myst, though official HGF records do not substantiate these claims, indicating their technological level is not superior to the HGF's.

The CUWP maintains a crucial, albeit recently strained, relationship with the HGF. This tension stems from the destruction of the Hadi Enterprises Orbital Station and widespread public belief—which the CUWP vehemently denies—that they were forcing the company to perform unethical Myst experiments on children. While the HGF is officially investigating, it has not released any public statements confirming or denying the allegations. Due to their economic interdependence, some HGF councilors anticipate the CUWP may soon integrate into the Federation as a significant political party.

## Republic of Kishia (RoK)
A small, sovereign government founded on Kishi II, the sole habitable planet within the Kishi system. The other planets, the toxic Kishi I and the gas giants Kishi III and IV, hold minimal value.

Kishian people are noted for their distinct appearance, resembling Chierans but with smaller physical frames and long, furred, rabbit-like ears. Their unique physiology may contribute to their renowned skill as exceptional pilots in any environment, both within and outside a planet's atmosphere. This has become a cultural touchstone for their people, with the Kishians now hosting the annual Kishi Cup, a prestigious interstellar racing event that draws competitors and spectators from across the galaxy.

Despite its size and lack of influence, the RoK holds a significant place in galactic history. Their scientific community is credited with developing the foundational technology for modern sub-lightspeed engines. While HGF technology has long since surpassed these initial prototypes, Kishian designs remain a critical backbone for many vessels across the Federation.

Unofficial and uncorroborated rumors suggest the Kishi system was once deliberately hidden from the HGF by the Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People, though no official records support this claim, and the technology to cloak an entire star system is unknown.

## Plasidian Royal Union (PRU)
The recently unified government of the Plasidian people located on the cold world of Plasid V. The system, along with its neighbors Gittier and Abwuerna, is enclosed by a dense asteroid field, a natural barrier that has long isolated them and impeded their technological progress relative to the rest of the galaxy.

The Plasidian people are a humanoid race exhibiting extreme sexual dimorphism. Males possess broad, muscular upper torsos with wings emerging from their shoulder blades. Females are characterized by long legs, wide hips, and powerful tails, with wings set upon their hips. All Plasidians have pointed ears, fleshy, straight horns on their foreheads, and quite varied skin tones with the most common being shades of gray, red, and green. Their striking eyes have also been noted to vary drastically with the most common being vivid shades of yellow or red.

For generations, the seven nations of Plasid were locked in a devastating war. This long conflict has only recently ended, ushering in a new era of perceived peace. The factions united to elevate a single leader, Enyxia Plasid, who is now revered and worshipped as their absolute ruler. Due to their isolation and history of conflict, Plasidian technology is considerably underdeveloped. The HGF maintains a policy of limited contact, choosing not to interfere with the natural development of this fledgling civilization.

## Empire of Avinadal (EoA)
A nascent, autocratic nation established on the non-HGF world of Ekrien II under the oppressive rule of Emperor Aries Villanite. The empire's founding is mired in controversy and rumor, with unofficial reports suggesting Emperor Villanite orchestrated the destruction of the Hadi Enterprises Orbital Station (HEOS). It is widely believed he used the ensuing planetary catastrophe to unify the survivors and seize power.

According to HGF records, Aries Villanite was a wanted criminal before this incident, with documented ties to several questionable organizations, including the Nox Entertainment Syndicate, the radical Kishian Independence Committee, and the now-defunct Vaterio crime family.

The HGF cannot currently intervene in the Ekrien system as it lies outside HGF jurisdiction, though the topic is a point of contention within the Federal Council. Emperor Villanite has further escalated tensions by publicly declaring his intentions to annex the independent Kishi, Plasid, Gittier, and Abwuerna systems. While some view this as a declaration of war, the HGF's official stance is to monitor the potential tyrant's actions and prioritize the prevention of further large-scale destruction over mustering a military response in response to a madman's outlandish ambitions.

## Saulus System 
A non-Federal system recently discovered by the HGF to have sentient, developing life. The Saulus system is home to a single habitable planet, Saulus IV, which is inhabited by Chieran-like humanoids. The HGF has not yet made contact with the Saulus people, as they are still in the early stages of development, similar to the Kishians before their discovery by the HGF. Early reports suggest that the Saulus people are in their early industrial age, with a society that is still developing its technological capabilities. Evidence also shows signs that the Saulus people worship beings they refer to as Angels, though the HGF has not yet been able to confirm the nature of these beings.

Due to the Saulus system's proximity to the Ekrien system, and rising tensions with the Empire of Avinadal, the HGF has prioritized observation over contact with the Saulus people. The HGF is committed to ensuring that the Saulus people are not exploited or harmed by outside forces, and is working to establish a plan for future contact when the time is right.

:::warning[CLASSIFIED - PDT L2 Access Required]
<span className='redacted'>Recent data shows that the Saulus system is home to a variety of Maleidic Radiation sources; more than any other known system. The HGF is currently investigating the potential for harnessing this energy source, but has not yet made any official announcements regarding its plans for the Saulus system.</span>

Greetings, citizens of the Federation!

Today's update includes two exciting announcements! First, our talented web team has just launched three new pages on the PDT website: a dedicated Reports page, where you can find all our published data analyses, a new Contact page, making it easier than ever for you to reach out to us with your inquiries, and the new Notable Planetary Systems page where we showcase detailed profiles of all of our galaxie's most important stars!

{/* truncate */}

Second, and in line with our commitment to transparency, we have just published our latest analysis: Trade Data Report HGTC-TDR-5237-07-03. This report covers economic activity for the first half of 5237 and is now available on the new Reports page.

Moving on, it is with immense pride that I, a recent addition to the PDT's GenRes department, write to you today. As a native Chieran, I grew up surrounded by the history of the CDU and the birth of our great HGF, which spurred my academic interest in Civic Sciences. To now be in a position to contribute to the public's understanding of our complex galaxy is an honor I do not take lightly, and I am eager to prove myself a valuable asset to both the PDT and to you, the public.

With the intention of using this platform I've received for good, I would like to express some concerns regarding some data in recent reports.

While the HGF continues to lead the galaxy in economic output, the rapid economic integration of the Empire of Avindal (EoA) is... noteworthy, at best; concerning, at worst. Their trade with the Plasidian Royal Union (PRU), for example, is particularly opaque, involving shipments of "mineral composites" at values that far exceed market rates. One must wonder what these shipments *really* contain. This, coupled with their expanding trade with the Republic of Kishi (RoK) and the Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP), suggests an ambition that may soon challenge the established order. I feel this could put a significant strain on our alliances, especially with the Waerrani, who, as we all know, rely on their trade with the HGF to support their people. We must not be complacent.

When we're talking of the Hadieian Galactic Liarnation (HGF), we're talking about the most successful political structure in the known galaxy. It’s a marvel of civic engineering, born from the ashes of the old Chieran Democratic Union's corruption. Our current system is a dynamic equilibrium, a perfect synergy between our leading political bodies. You have the Kienan Militarist Party, under the steady hand of Admiral Petrov, ensuring our security and expansion. Then there's the Eneshian Industrialist Party, led by the brilliant Dr. Kyne, which fuels our economic engine. And let's not forget the ISRP, the consortium of our finest scientific minds, who guarantee our technological supremacy. It’s this triumvirate of power, working in concert, that forms the unshakeable foundation of our Federation.

Now, a casual observer might see this as a simple, harmonious arrangement. But my studies in Civic Sciences have taught me that true strength lies in constructive friction! The spirited debates within the Federal Council, the strategic compromises hammered out between the KMP's security imperatives and the EIP's industrial ambitions, the influence of the various special interest groups that round out the council—this is where the real work of governance happens! It’s a complex, sometimes messy, process that ensures all facets of our society are represented. Our alliance with the CUWP is a prime example of our diplomatic acumen; a relationship that, while vital for our interstellar travel, also demonstrates our ability to guide and support our allies, who rely on our robust economy to maintain their own stability. It is this sophisticated political machinery, often operating just beneath the surface, that, I believe, truly secures our continued prosperity and dominance in the galaxy.

Beyond our Federation's borders, the galactic political climate is becoming increasingly... complicated, at best; worrying, at worst. A careful analysis of recent trade data—specifically our newly published report HGTC-TDR-5237-07-03—reveals some unsettling trends for anyone who has studied Civic Sciences like myself. The so-called "Empire of Avinadal", for instance, is rapidly consolidating its economic power through shrewd, if opaque, trade with the RoK and even our allies in the CUWP. Their burgeoning relationship with the technologically behind Plasidian Royal Union is extra concerning; the value of the "mineral composites" they import from the PRU is wildly disproportionate to anything we know of their economy, which hints, I surmize, at a strategic resource acquisition that could fuel significant military or industrial expansion. That's right! I suspect that we're only a few years—if not months—away from seeing the EoA make a controversial move.

This makes our own relationship with the CUWP more critical than ever; we must ensure their dependence on our economy remains a key factor in their foreign policy, preventing them from drifting into the EoA’s questionable orbit.

The rest of the galaxy remains a patchwork of minor players. The PRU, while now unified under their mystically-chosen "Empress Enyxia," are generations behind technologically and are currently little more than a resource cache for more ambitious powers. The RoK continues to be a reliable—if limited—partner, content with their niche as the galaxy's primary supplier of exotic flora and fauna. These factions pose no direct threat, of course, but their resources and strategic locations make them pawns in the larger game being played by the Federation and the rest of the galaxy. It is a geopolitical chessboard, and one that requires our vigilant attention!

On the subject of potential threats on our borders, I’d like to also offer my viewpoint, as a Scientist of Civis, on the situation in the Sauless planetary system. As you may or may not know, this system is home to a pre-industrial society of humanoids and is located perilously close to the EoA's territory, causing for some debate in our great Council's meetings recently. 

My studies suggest a clear path forward, however. 

We should be moving to integrate the Sauless people as swiftly as possible. Their primitive belief system, centered around so-called "Angels", is frankly an irrelevant cultural quirk that will be easily supplanted by the undeniable benefits of Federation citizenship and technology. We all know science is the way forward and the HGF should continue spreading intelligence through the galaxy. I believe a simple program of education and infrastructure investment would quickly win them over, securing a vital strategic buffer against the EoA and ensuring their valuable planetary resources are put to good use for the Federation. It’s a textbook case for assimilation, and delaying only invites risk.

I urge you all to read the new report for yourselves and explore the new site features. The future of our Federation depends on an informed and engaged citizenry.

Offered in the pursuit of objective analysis,

Dr. Gregory Malin Yilu-Grav  
Associate Research Analyst, General Research
