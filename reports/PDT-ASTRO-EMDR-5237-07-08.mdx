# Exploration & Monitoring Drone Report  
**Subject:** Status Overview of HGF Drone Operations Across Known Systems  
**Date:** 5237-07-08 UST  
**Prepared by:** HGF Exploration & Monitoring Division

## Executive Summary

This report provides an operational status update for all active HGF exploration and monitoring drones deployed across the major star systems of the Hadieia galaxy. All data is current as of the above date. Notably, all drones operating within Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP) territories have ceased transmitting, with no telemetry or sensor data available.

## System Observations

- **CUWP-Owned Territories (Waerr, Daeve, Tauling, Turvail, Milinoz):**
  - All deployed drones have ceased transmission upon entering these systems.
  - No telemetry, sensor, or environmental data available.
  - Investigation ongoing; presumed loss or interference.
- **Kishi System:**
  - This drone has been in need of maintenance for some time, but it seems to finally be dead. May need to send a retreival vessel out, but maintenance crew requests and retrieval crew requests have been denied due to 'unforeseen complications in the area'. Leadership is aware, Astro can take no further action until we are approved for maintenance or retrieval.
- **Other Systems:**
  - All drones report nominal status.
  - Routine exploration, environmental monitoring, and planetary survey data received.
  - No significant anomalies or interruptions detected.

## Department Statement

All HGF drones continue to operate nominally across the majority of surveyed star systems. The loss of data from CUWP-owned territories is consistent with prior incidents of drone disappearance in these regions. There is no evidence at this time to suggest cause for alarm. Kishi drone failure is expected considering prior reports from the malfunctioning drone. Monitoring and investigation will continue as per standard protocol.
