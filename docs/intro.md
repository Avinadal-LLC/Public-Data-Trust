# Welcome to the Avilium Wiki
 
This website is made with the purpose of documenting all pertinent universe details for UoA Content Creators. This wiki should be used as a 'bible' of sorts for Avilium Content Creators to ensure that any content created specifically for Avilium properly aligns with the current state of the universe's canon.

## What is Avilium?

The Universe of Avilium, or UoA, is a fictional universe created and maintained by the Avinadal community as a project for community members. While all content found on this website is community-driven, everything published here is the intellectual property of Avinadal LLC with approval from the community contributors.

## How to Participate

In order to participate in content creation efforts and activities for UoA, you must join the [Avinadal Discord Server](https://discord.gg/avinadal) and complete the age verification process and prove you are 18 years of age or older. Once you are officially a member of the community and have verified that you are an adult, you can start by following the [Getting Started guide on this site](/getting-started).

## How to Support

The Universe of Avilium is owned, maintained, and managed by Avinadal LLC. While we always encourage supporting the content creators directly, if you want to support Avinadal LLC, you can do so in the following ways:

- [Universe of Avilium Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Avilium) - Patreon allows you to support us by signing up for a monthly subscription. Depending on the subscription tier selected, you will also gain access to unique perks like early access to content, access to draft content, or even the opportunity to vote on the outcome of specific canon-impacting events.
- [Villanite's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/villanite) - Because Villanite, as an entity, is owned by Avinadal LLC, subscriptions made to Villanite's Twitch channel feed directly into the Avinadal budget, meaning that by supporting Villanite on Twitch, you are also supporting Avinadal.

### Supporting UoA Creators

If you would like to support the creators involved with UoA directly, rather than Avinadal itself, you can join the [Avinadal Discord Server](https://discord.gg/avinadal) where you'll find a number of social media channels that showcase all of the creators we support as part of our community.

:::warning[Please Note]
    Please note that while age verification on the Discord server is not required to view the social media feed channels, all content created by Avinadal is meant for adult audiences only. If we have reason to believe you are a minor and have joined our server, you will be banned from the server without question. As such, if you are a minor with a desire to join the Avinadal community, please wait until you are old enough.

## Getting Started
