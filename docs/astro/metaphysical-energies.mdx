# Metaphysical Energies

## Maleidic Radiation

Maleidic Radiation was discovered by Doctor Idris Hadi, who named it after the late love of his life, Maleida Hadi. While researching a unique energy reading they discovered on the planet Vogel, Dr. Hadi designed a device that could harness the energy of the radiation. While the radiation's energy was not enough to be used as a power source on its own, Dr. Hadi's device was able to amplify the radiation to extraordinary levels. Over the course of several years, Dr. Hadi founded Hadi Enterprises, developing his initial device into the Hadi Enterprises Maleidic Power Plant (HEMPP). Under Dr. Idris' leadership, the HEMPP became the primary energy source of three different megacities on Vogel, revolutionizing the planet's energy infrastructure.

While Dr. Hadi was in the Chiera system overseeing the construction of the Hadi Enterprises Orbital Station (HEOS), tragedy struck the HEMPP as an unexpected spike in energy from the Maleidic Radiation caused an explosion inside the facility. While the explosion was contained, it caused a significant amount of damage to the HEMPP, killing everyone inside.

After the tragedy, the Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FIST) contracted Dr. Hadi to continue his research with full Federal funding. The Federation's partnership with Hadi Enterprises has since led to the discovery and development of several new Maleidic Fonts, the name given to the containable 'clouds' of Maleidic Radiation that can be harvested for energy. These fonts are now used in various applications, from powering factories to fueling cities. To this day, however, no fonts have come close to the energy output of the original HEMPP, which remains a testament to Dr. Hadi's groundbreaking work.

:::tip[Cultural Note]
There are several folklore stories from old Kienan communities that talk about the "Maleh'ee," a realm between life and death where the souls of the damned wander for all eternity, drifting into one another until they are driven mad by their own hunger and forced to devour other souls they encounter. Kienan kids are urged to behave and follow orders, or a hungry, twisted soul from the Maleh'ee would mistake them as evil and tear a rift in the veil between life and death to drag them into Maleh'ee to eat their soul.

## Myst Particles

In recent years, quantum research teams at the FIST have confirmed the existence of a unique particle that seems to play a foundational role in the universe around us. Early studies suggest that these "Myst Particles" are not only responsible for the fundamental forces of nature but also for the very fabric of reality itself. They are theorized to be the building blocks of all matter and energy, existing in a state that transcends our conventional understanding of physics.

Early news about Myst Particles sparked a wave of excitement, theories, and speculation; some more outlandish than others. Detailed research by the FIST has since confirmed that the discovery of these particles does not mean that humanity can manipulate reality at will, but rather that these particles are the key to understanding the universe's fundamental laws. 

Most recently, the FIST employed a dedicated team led by Dr. Hadi to research the potential of using Myst Particles as an energy source. According to credible sources, Dr. Hadi's team was making significant progress until an attack on the HEOS destroyed the facility. The attack on the massive station triggered a meltdown in the Myst reactor they were working on, resulting in an explosion that desintegrated a large portion of the station.

Theories about the explosion began circulating after the rumored discovery of black box data from the HEOS. While no official confirmation has been made, it is believed that the explosion was caused by Dr. Hadi's selfless decision to trigger the meltdown in order to minimize the damage done by the attack causing the colossal station to crash into Ekrien II, the non-Federal planet being orbited by the HEOS.

Today, the FIST continues to research Myst Particles, hoping to unlock their secrets and harness their potential for the benefit of all humanity. The discovery of these particles has opened up new avenues of research and exploration, promising to reshape our understanding of the universe and our place within it.
