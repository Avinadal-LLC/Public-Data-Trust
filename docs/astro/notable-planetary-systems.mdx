# Notable Planetary Systems

This document provides an overview of notable planetary systems within our galaxy, focusing on their star types, planets, and other celestial elements.
Each system has unique characteristics and plays, or has played, a significant role in the development of our broader known galaxy.

As should be expected, the information provided here does not include systems that have not been colonized, explored, or otherwise impactful to the development of our civilization.
Likewise, as the galaxy is vast and ever-changing, the information provided here may not be always be up-to-date.
PDT staff are committed to update this document as information and resourcing becomes available.
If you spot any errors or omissions, please submit a ticket to the PDT team for review.
