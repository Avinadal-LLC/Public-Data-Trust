# Known Factions

## Hadieia Galactic Federation (HGF)
The largest and most powerful governmental body in the known galaxy, renowned for its leadership in the defense, industrial, and biotech sectors. Its capital is on Eneshia II.

Originally known as the Chieran Democratic Union (CDU), with its capital on Chiera III, a shift in power occurred following the Chieran System War. This conflict was ignited when activists and whistleblowers exposed deep-rooted corruption within the CDU's political structure. A rebellion, originating in the Eneshia system and supported by the Kiena system, successfully overthrew the corrupt regime, leading to the formation of the HGF.

The HGF is governed by the Federal Council. Key factions include the Eneshian Industrialist Party (EIP), led by Doctor Melinda Kyne, and the Kienan Militarist Party (KMP), led by Fleet Master Admiral Ulrich Petrov, each holding 20% of the council seats. The EIP drives the Federation's industrial complex, while the KMP spearheads its defense and colonization efforts. The Independent Scientific Research Party (ISRP), a coalition of influential science and technology corporations, constitutes 15% of the council and oversees the prestigious Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FIST). The remaining 45% is composed of various special interest groups, lobbyists, and watchdog organizations.

The HGF's primary mission is to ensure galactic security and peace through strategic exploration, collaboration, and unification.

Due to the origins of the people in the HGF, people from the HGF are often referred to as Chierans, even though the HGF is a multi-system government. This has become a point of contention within the Federal Council. While the EIP and ISRP support the use of the term as a sign of respect to our origins, members of the KMP have been referring to the people of the HGF as Hadiens. Meanwhile, the remaining parties of the Federal Council have remained too divided on the issue for the council to take a unified stance on the matter.

Culturally speaking, the HGF has heavily embraced technology and innovation, with a strong emphasis on scientific research and development. The Federation's citizens are known for their pragmatism, valuing efficiency and progress above all else. This has led to a society that is unparalleld with advanced communication networks and transportation systems facilitating the exchange of ideas and resources across the known galaxy.

## Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP)
A government established by the Waerrani people following their expansion from their home system of Waerr. The CUWP is currently undertaking slow colonization efforts in the Daeve, Tauling, Turvail, and Milinoz systems, prioritizing planetary preservation over rapid expansion. This deliberate pace necessitates a heavy reliance on trade with the HGF to support its populace.

Physically, the Waerrani people bear a resemblance to the Chierans of the HGF but are distinguished by their vividly colored hair, unique eye hues, consistently olive or tan skin, and pointed ears. Conspiracity theorists persist that the Waerrani have mastered Mystech, a rumored technological application of Myst, though official HGF records do not substantiate these claims, indicating their technological level is not superior to the HGF's.

The CUWP maintains a crucial, albeit recently strained, relationship with the HGF. This tension stems from the destruction of the Hadi Enterprises Orbital Station and widespread public belief—which the CUWP vehemently denies—that they were forcing the company to perform unethical Myst experiments on children. While the HGF is officially investigating, it has not released any public statements confirming or denying the allegations. Due to their economic interdependence, some HGF councilors anticipate the CUWP may soon integrate into the Federation as a significant political party.

## Republic of Kishia (RoK)
A small, sovereign government founded on Kishi II, the sole habitable planet within the Kishi system. The other planets, the toxic Kishi I and the gas giants Kishi III and IV, hold minimal value.

Kishian people are noted for their distinct appearance, resembling Chierans but with smaller physical frames and long, furred, rabbit-like ears. Their unique physiology may contribute to their renowned skill as exceptional pilots in any environment, both within and outside a planet's atmosphere. This has become a cultural touchstone for their people, with the Kishians now hosting the annual Kishi Cup, a prestigious interstellar racing event that draws competitors and spectators from across the galaxy.

Despite its size and lack of influence, the RoK holds a significant place in galactic history. Their scientific community is credited with developing the foundational technology for modern sub-lightspeed engines. While HGF technology has long since surpassed these initial prototypes, Kishian designs remain a critical backbone for many vessels across the Federation.

Unofficial and uncorroborated rumors suggest the Kishi system was once deliberately hidden from the HGF by the Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People, though no official records support this claim, and the technology to cloak an entire star system is unknown.

## Plasidian Royal Union (PRU)
The recently unified government of the Plasidian people located on the cold world of Plasid V. The system, along with its neighbors Gittier and Abwuerna, is enclosed by a dense asteroid field, a natural barrier that has long isolated them and impeded their technological progress relative to the rest of the galaxy.

The Plasidian people are a humanoid race exhibiting extreme sexual dimorphism. Males possess broad, muscular upper torsos with wings emerging from their shoulder blades. Females are characterized by long legs, wide hips, and powerful tails, with wings set upon their hips. All Plasidians have pointed ears, fleshy, straight horns on their foreheads, and quite varied skin tones with the most common being shades of gray, red, and green. Their striking eyes have also been noted to vary drastically with the most common being vivid shades of yellow or red.

For generations, the seven nations of Plasid were locked in a devastating war. This long conflict has only recently ended, ushering in a new era of perceived peace. The factions united to elevate a single leader, Enyxia Plasid, who is now revered and worshipped as their absolute ruler. Due to their isolation and history of conflict, Plasidian technology is considerably underdeveloped. The HGF maintains a policy of limited contact, choosing not to interfere with the natural development of this fledgling civilization.

## Empire of Avinadal (EoA)
A nascent, autocratic nation established on the non-HGF world of Ekrien II under the oppressive rule of Emperor Aries Villanite. The empire's founding is mired in controversy and rumor, with unofficial reports suggesting Emperor Villanite orchestrated the destruction of the Hadi Enterprises Orbital Station (HEOS). It is widely believed he used the ensuing planetary catastrophe to unify the survivors and seize power.

According to HGF records, Aries Villanite was a wanted criminal before this incident, with documented ties to several questionable organizations, including the Nox Entertainment Syndicate, the radical Kishian Independence Committee, and the now-defunct Vaterio crime family.

The HGF cannot currently intervene in the Ekrien system as it lies outside HGF jurisdiction, though the topic is a point of contention within the Federal Council. Emperor Villanite has further escalated tensions by publicly declaring his intentions to annex the independent Kishi, Plasid, Gittier, and Abwuerna systems. While some view this as a declaration of war, the HGF's official stance is to monitor the potential tyrant's actions and prioritize the prevention of further large-scale destruction over mustering a military response in response to a madman's outlandish ambitions.

## Saulus System 
A non-Federal system recently discovered by the HGF to have sentient, developing life. The Saulus system is home to a single habitable planet, Saulus IV, which is inhabited by Chieran-like humanoids. The HGF has not yet made contact with the Saulus people, as they are still in the early stages of development, similar to the Kishians before their discovery by the HGF. Early reports suggest that the Saulus people are in their early industrial age, with a society that is still developing its technological capabilities. Evidence also shows signs that the Saulus people worship beings they refer to as Angels, though the HGF has not yet been able to confirm the nature of these beings.

Due to the Saulus system's proximity to the Ekrien system, and rising tensions with the Empire of Avinadal, the HGF has prioritized observation over contact with the Saulus people. The HGF is committed to ensuring that the Saulus people are not exploited or harmed by outside forces, and is working to establish a plan for future contact when the time is right.

:::warning[CLASSIFIED - PDT L2 Access Required]
<span className='redacted'>Recent data shows that the Saulus system is home to a variety of Maleidic Radiation sources; more than any other known system. The HGF is currently investigating the potential for harnessing this energy source, but has not yet made any official announcements regarding its plans for the Saulus system.</span>
