# Travel

Travel comes in many different shapes and sizes across Avilium. While this documentation may not cover every single method of travel, we'll try to cover as many pertinent methods as possible. 

## Land/Ocean/Air Travel

Generally speaking, most of the planets associated directly with any of the Civ Races are known to have some sort of engineered people movers from private vehicles to mass transit systems. Some planets also have different fauna and, in some case, even some flora that can be utilized for travel. The methods used to accomplish this vary from planet to planet and creature to creature.

## Space Travel

As more and more cultures began contributing to space travel technology, the people of Avilium eventually realized that they needed some sort of standardization to support the different types of ships. The Travel Standardization Association was founded as a non-political organization to unite engineers, mechanics, and architects across Avilium, allowing them to work together in the development of a classification system for ships allowing for efficient development of technology in the industry.

Jetships are generally small, single-engine, single-seater ships designed for a mixture of speed, mobility, and stealth depending on the purpose of the ship. Examples of jetships include several models of military fighters, bombers, commercial racing ships, and private civilian-owned vessels. A jetship usually has enough fuel to travel from one planet to another before needing to refuel at the destination.

  <TabItem value="squadships" label="Squadships">
Squadships are larger than jetships and can have up to three engines before they fall out of the classification. These ships are seen as two-to-five-seaters depending on model. Many of them can be piloted by a single pilot, leaving the other seats open for passengers. These ships don't have particularly notable storage options, much like jetships, are usually meant for travel of the crew and passengers rather than cargo. Examples of squadships also include a multitude of military fighters, bombers, and private civilian-owned vessels. 

While racing leagues for squadships have been created, they're much less popular and the commercial use of squadships tends to lean more towards taxi services. Squadships are developed with the fuel capacity to travel to another planet and back before needing to refuel. Travel to another nearby star in a squadship is possible for some of the larger models, but they all require the use of an expensive and temporary thruster.

  <TabItem value="dropships" label="Dropships">
Dropships can often comfortably transport up to 50 passengers at their largest and up to 10 passengers at the smallest scale. Military, commercial, and private use dropships can vary drastically from model to model. Some of the larger ones can even be used as long-term housing. Many dropships are capable of making a trip to a nearby star without the need for any extra equipment, though some smaller dropships still require the use of the same temporary thruster system that squadships use.

  <TabItem value="carrierships" label="Carrierships">
When a dropship isn't big enough to carry everyone you need it to carry, you opt for a carriership. At their smallest, carrierships are designed to comfortably transport 100 people and a couple jetships while the largest carrierships can hold millions of people, have fully stocked hangers filled with jetships, squadships, and dropships. Some carrierships support full artificial habitats for creatures of all types. These ships are designed for prolonged space travel, some capable of maintaining up to three generations of on-board crews before completely depleting their resources.
