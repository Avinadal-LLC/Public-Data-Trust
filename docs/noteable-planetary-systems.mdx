## Ekrien

### Star Type

* Binary System:
    * Primary: K-type main sequence star (cool, orange, stable)
    * Secondary: M-type red dwarf (dimmer, red, long-lived)
* The two stars orbit a common center of mass (barycenter), creating a dynamic gravitational and light environment for the system.

### System Structure

* Configuration:
    * "Wide binary" configuration: Both stars are far enough apart that planets orbit the combined mass of the binary in stable circumbinary orbits.
    * The habitable zone is defined by the combined luminosity, but with some variability due to the orbital motion of the stars.

### Planets

* Ekrien I:
    * Type: Rocky
    * Size: 4.05 Mm
    * Orbit: 0.35 AU (hot, mineral-rich, very rare valuable ore, uninhabitable)
* Ekrien II:
    * Type: Terrestrial
    * Size: 6.42 Mm
    * Orbit: 0.8 AU (edge of habitable zone, possible early colonization attempts)

    * Orbit: 7.5 AU (hosts several icy moons, potential for mining and research bases)
* Orbital Ranges:
    * All planets orbit the barycenter of the binary, with stable orbits starting beyond a minimum safe distance from the stars (usually 2--4 times the binary separation).

### Other Celestial Elements

* Asteroid Belt:
    * Between Ekrien III and IV, shaped by the gravitational influence of both stars.
* Cometary Cloud:
    * Beyond Ekrien V, source of long-period comets.
* Moons:
    * Ekrien II: 1 moderate-sized moon (climate stabilizer)
    * Ekrien IV: 3 major moons (mining and outposts)

### Binary Effects on the System

* Illumination:
    * Planets experience dual sunrises and sunsets, with periodic changes in light intensity as the stars move in their orbits.
* Climate:
    * Potential for more complex seasons and day-night cycles, especially for planets closer to the binary pair.
* Stability:
    * Planetary orbits are stable as long as they are sufficiently distant from the binary stars' barycenter.

## Eneshia

### Star Type

* G-type main sequence star (similar to our Sun; supports life and advanced civilization on Eneshia II).

### Planets

* Eneshia I:

### Other Celestial Elements

* Asteroid Belt:
    * Located between Gittier II and III, part of the dense Plagiab Field that surrounds Gittier, Plasid, and Abwuerna. This makes observation and safe travel difficult.
* Cometary Cloud:
    * Beyond Gittier V, contributing to the Plagiab Field and supplying water ice to the outer system.
* Moons
    * Gittier III: 2 small, icy moons (geologically inactive, but may contain water ice).
    * Gittier IV: 3 icy moons (potential for research outposts or resource extraction of rare volatiles).

### System Notes

* Gittier is one of the systems surrounded by the dense Plagiab Field, making it difficult to observe and safely visit.
* The Empire of Avinadal (EoA), has recently proclaimed that the Gittier system will soon become part of their empire. This claim is largely unaddressed by the Hadieian Galactic Federation (HGF) due to their official stance of non-intervention in systems they do not govern.
* Due to the challenges presented by the Plagiab Field, less is known about the Gittier system compared to others, and official interactions with any potential indigenous life are limited.

## Kiena

### Star Type

* G-type main sequence star (similar to our Sun, stable, supporting a moderately sized habitable zone).

### Planets

* Cometary Cloud:
    * Beyond Kiena V, supplies water ice and volatile compounds to the inner system, contributing to the potential habitability of Kiena III.
* Moons:
    * Kiena III: 1 large moon (stabilizes the planet's axial tilt, contributes to tidal forces, and could be a site for secondary settlements).
    * Kiena IV: 5 major moons, at least two with strong indications of subsurface oceans, making them prime candidates for future exploration and scientific research.

### System Notes

* The Kiena system played a crucial role in the founding of the Hadieian Galactic Federation (HGF), with support from the Kiena system being instrumental in the rebellion that led to the HGF's establishment.
* The Kienan Militarist Party (KMP), led by Fleet Master Admiral Ulrich Petrov, has made Kiena a military-focused planetary system. As such, Kiena is a central hub for HGF defense and colonization efforts.
* Given its strategic importance to the HGF, the Kiena system is heavily fortified and has significant infrastructure for military and colonization operations.

### System Notes

* Cultural Impact:
    * The Kishian people's legendary piloting skills are partly attributed to the challenging terrain and atmospheric conditions of Kishi II.
* Cloaking Technology:
    * {{The CUWP used a proprietary system to mask the entire Kishi system from all known forms of detection, a feat considered impossible by most galactic powers.}}
    * {{This protection allowed the Republic of Kishia to develop independently and avoid resource exploitation by outside factions, notably the MGF.}}
* Current Status:
    * With the cloaking field now lifted, Kishi II is a coveted ecological and cultural jewel, fiercely protected by its inhabitants and allies.

### System Notes

* The Cybercratic Union of Waerrani People (CUWP) originated from the Waerr planetary system.
* The Waerrani completely strip-mined Waerr III, converting the entire planet into a machine, a technological achievement they collectively regret. This has motivated them to pursue conservative colonization efforts focused on healthy terraformation and planetary preservation.
* Other planets in the Waerr system also show signs of heavy machinification from early colonization efforts, but the CUWP was able to prevent irreversible damage, leading to a cultural focus on integrating technology with nature.
