        question: "Do I absolutely have to join the Discord server to work with the community?",
        answer: "At this time, we do not offer sign-up functionality on the website, so everything has to be done via the Discord server. Hopefully, in the future, we will integrate membership functionality for the site along with content submission and review features."
    },
    {
        question: "Is adult content allowed in this community?",
        answer: "Yes! The Avinadal community is adult-only and very open to discussions and conversations about healthy kink lifestyles and fictional kink and fetish content."
    },
    {
        question: "Does all content have to be erotic?",
        answer: "Not at all. From a content-creation point of view, Avilium is open to all genres. While some of the writers have their own interests in writing erotic content, not everyone has to participate or is even expected to participate in creating that content. With that in mind, please note that we don't have any content censorship functionality built into the website just yet, so please use your discretion while navigating the site and be sure to click away from any content you're not interested in."
    },
    {
        question: "I see my content here, but I never gave permissions. What do I do?",
        answer: "Oh no! First of all, we're very sorry that this has happened! We try to make sure everyone is okay with their art work being used, but sometimes communication can fail us. If you have found your content on this site and want to have it taken down or be included Credits page, please reach out to Villanite directly via Discord (Villanite)."
    },
    {
        question: "My question wasn't answered. Who should I reach out to?",
        answer: "You can join the <a href='https://discord.gg/avinadal' target='_blank'>Avinadal Discord Server</a> and ask your question there after your age is verified. Please do not reach out directly to any of the Avinadal staff about this, using the Discord server is the only proper path and staff members may block you if you reach out randomly."
